[![CI Orchestrator](https://github.com/xver-por-ver/php-auth-core/actions/workflows/ci-orchestrator.yml/badge.svg?branch=main&event=push)](https://github.com/xver-por-ver/php-auth-core/actions/workflows/ci-orchestrator.yml)

## Continuous Integration

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration.

The main workflow is `.github/workflows/ci-orchestrator.yml`, which delegates to reusable workflows in this order:

1. `.github/workflows/symfony-recipe-check.yml` checks whether Symfony Flex recipes are outdated.
2. `.github/workflows/application-quality-assurance.yml` runs the application quality checks after the recipe check succeeds.

CI runs on pushes and pull requests targeting `main`, except for documentation-only changes, license updates, and changes under `translations/`.

The application quality workflow performs:

- Composer validation
- Dependency installation
- PHPUnit test suite execution with coverage output
- Psalm static analysis

## Symfony Recipe Maintenance

`.github/workflows/symfony-recipe-maintenance.yml` keeps Symfony Flex recipes current. It runs on pushes and pull requests targeting `main`, on a weekly schedule, and by manual dispatch.

When recipe updates are available, it applies `composer recipes:update`, commits the changes, and opens or updates the `automated/symfony-recipe-updates` pull request. If a recipe update fails or creates conflicts, the workflow fails so the update can be resolved manually.
